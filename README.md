Kokaplate (Beta)
=========

A generator for simple static webpages.

Kokaplate is a collection of tools to generate static websites. The tool should make it possible to simply start coding without boring 
configurations or to download all the cool frameworks you need for your website. Also the tool simplify your workflow because you must only use a few commands to build or watch your files. The tool is a little bit like the tool Yeoman from Google, when you don't heard since now from this project you must definitely visit this website: [http://yeoman.io/](http://yeoman.io/) but Yeoman is a generator for Web-Applications but the Niche of Static-Websites wasn't covered so i started this project.

I hope my little tool can help you and when you have nothing to do or you are bored my code you could contribute to this project or give me simply tips for better code praxis or something like that.
